This project was inspired by "Stockfish" a famous chess engine. So i tried to create my own chess engine. There are many ways to create a chess cheater by using Machine Learning Reinforcement Learning, or Search Engine like a "Stockfish".

## Board Representation
In this project, I chose the bitboard representation because it is widely used among chess engines due to its efficiency and powerful bitwise operations. Bitboards allow for fast move generation, board manipulation, and evaluation, making them perfect choice for high-performance chess engines.
